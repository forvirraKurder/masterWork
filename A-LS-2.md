# Assignment LS-2: Energy-Modelling for Large Signal Stability Analysis of AC Power systems

This assignment (as well as the following one) aims to analytically replicate a powerful stability result published in 
2014 by J. Schiffer et al. in “Conditions for stability of droop-controlled inverter-based microgrids”, 
Automatica, Volume 50, Issue 10, October 2014. 
More precisely we are interested in replicating the results that have been presented in section 5 of that article, 
entitled “stability for lossless microgrids”; which in our opinion, is a good starting point for large-signal stability 
analysis of power systems. The stability proof detailed in section 5, can be divided into two parts---which will 
correspond to the two different assignments. 

Given that some of the details can be arguably considered too complicated, you can count on the assistance from 
Gilbert on Tuesdays from 12h-15h in classroom 265 Sentralbygg 1 every week… (or whenever he is free in his office).

**Task**: 

The first part of the proof is to show that the dynamical model of a lossless microgrid/power system admits an 
“energy model”; or more formally, the port-Hamiltonian representation $\dot{x}=(J-R(x))\nabla H(x)$;
with the energy function H(x) selected as equation (33) in the article. 
The task is to replicate this proof in your notebook, understanding all the required mathematical details.

**Deliverables**: 

Your notes of the mathematical derivation, which you should be able to defend in the oral session.

# Assignment PF1: Power Flow solvers

The first assignment in the specialisation course module: Methods & algorithms in power systems.


**Task 1**:

Implement Newton-Raphson, FDPF and DCPF for power systems.

Low ambition level: pseudo-code

Medium ambition level: hard-code for the three-bus example

High ambition level: make a general implementation. A "converter" is included so you can import different cases from the open-source package "pandapower". 


**Task 2**:

Write three tests for your code. These tests should demonstrate your knowledge of the method.


Note: Assessment focuses on how well you demonstrate understanding of the power system principles, not on programming proficiency.

------------------------------------

Rules of the game!
- Commit and push, frequently!
- Write good commit messages
- Commit history serves as documentation of your work process
- Push unsuccessful attempts too!
- Follow the AI guidelines as given by the IE-faculty. Don't give your learning away :)
- AI speeds up what you don't want to study (syntax, structure, debugging etc.)
- And also as a learning companion

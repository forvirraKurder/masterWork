# Assignment SS-1: modal analysis

The first small-signal assignment in the specialisation course module: Methods & algorithms in power systems.

**Task**:

Conduct a modal analysis on the power system from A-LS-1.

**Presentation**:

Present plots that show:

- Poorly damped eigenvalues and their link to physical/meaningful states (e.g. mode shapes, participation factors)
- Parameter sweeps with participation indicated
- A perturbation of two specific modes (of your choice)
- 
You may present this directly in your code (functions and some comments) or in a pdf uploaded to your repo.

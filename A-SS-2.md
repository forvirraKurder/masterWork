# Assignment SS-2: frequency-domain analysis

The second small-signal assignment in the specialisation course module: Methods & algorithms in power systems.

In this assignment, you will conduct a frequency domain analysis on the power system from A-LS-1.


**Task**:

1. Choose a particular input-output pair for design and tuning.
2. Linearize the system and put it in block-diagram form.
3. Through block diagram reduction, present the open-loop transfer function, analytically. You
should be able to "read" the frequency response from this transfer function.
4. In TOPS, compute the frequency response of the open-loop transfer function and compare to 3.
5. Show stability margins and discuss what influences them.
6. Compute also the closed-loop response (in TOPS) and discuss performance.

**Presentation**:
1. Linearized block-diagrams for the chosen loop. Assumptions should be stated clearly.
2. Open loop transfer function expressions. 
3. Open loop frequency response plots (e.g., Bode, Nyquist) with stability margins.
4. Closed loop frequency response

Which tuning considerations are important for stability? And for performance?

I will ask for your interpretation of 2 - 4, orally.

You may present directly in your code (functions, pngs, comments) or in a pdf uploaded to your repo.
